# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely-used dataset for training and testing machine learning models, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hasanFashtook/ai-cnn.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have activated your Python environment.

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # for macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # for Windows
    ```

2. Run the `mnist_cnn.py` script.

    ```bash
    python mnist_cnn.py
    ```

3. The script will train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset and display the training progress and evaluation results.
